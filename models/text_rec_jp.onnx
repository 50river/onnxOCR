# PLACEHOLDER: Japanese Text Recognition Model
# This is a placeholder file for the Japanese text recognition ONNX model.
#
# The actual model file should be:
# - A trained CRNN or Transformer-based text recognition model
# - Optimized for Japanese characters (hiragana, katakana, kanji, numbers, symbols)
# - Optimized for ONNX Runtime Web
# - Input: Cropped text line images
# - Output: Character sequence probabilities
# - Typical size: 20-100MB
#
# To obtain the actual model:
# 1. Train a text recognition model on Japanese text datasets
# 2. Ensure compatibility with the charset_jp.txt character set
# 3. Convert to ONNX format with appropriate optimization
# 4. Test compatibility with ONNX Runtime Web
# 5. Replace this placeholder file
#
# Expected input shape: [1, 3, 32, width] (normalized text line image)
# Expected output: [sequence_length, num_classes] probability matrix
