# PLACEHOLDER: Text Detection Model
# This is a placeholder file for the text detection ONNX model.
# 
# The actual model file should be:
# - A trained DBNet or similar text detection model
# - Optimized for ONNX Runtime Web
# - Input: RGB image (3 channels)
# - Output: Text region probability maps
# - Typical size: 10-50MB
#
# To obtain the actual model:
# 1. Train a text detection model (DBNet, EAST, etc.)
# 2. Convert to ONNX format with appropriate optimization
# 3. Test compatibility with ONNX Runtime Web
# 4. Replace this placeholder file
#
# Expected input shape: [1, 3, height, width]
# Expected output: probability maps for text regions
